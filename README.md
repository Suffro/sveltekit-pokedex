# [SveltKit Pokedex](#)

#### This is and excercise project I made to practice [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). This project (like the name suggests), is a directory to search Pokemons, like a Pokedex.

To get all the pokemons data I used [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## What is [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)?

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.
Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.

## What is [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)?

SvelteKit is a Svelte-based framework (kinda like NextJs is for React), for building web applications of all sizes, with a smooth development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.

Unlike single-page apps, SvelteKit doesn't compromise on SEO, progressive enhancement or the initial load experience â€” but unlike traditional server-rendered apps, navigation is instantaneous for that app-like feel.
