# [SveltKit Pokedex](https://sveltekitpokedex-8934.netlify.app/)

#### This is an exercise I did to practice [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). This project (like the name suggests), is a directory to search Pokemons, aka a Pokedex. You can demo the project [here](https://sveltekitpokedex-8934.netlify.app/).

To get all the pokemons data I used [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

### If you want to test it locally, you can follow the following instructions:

#### 1. Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suffro/sveltekit-pokedex
```

#### 2. Install dependencies and run the project

Once you've cloned the repo of the project you need to install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`) and then run the app:
```bash
npm install
```
Then:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or open the app in a new browser tab:
```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```
